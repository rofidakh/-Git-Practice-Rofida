I’m Rofida Khalid.
 I don’t think I can fit myself into just a few lines, but here’s a start: I’m an ambitious person who’s always working on improving herself to reach a place where I’m the one making the final decisions.
 I fully believe in God’s guidance, but I also know that success comes from effort and persistence.

I love things that are full of life, and one of the best ways
I express my passion is through cooking — it’s my way to relax and recharge.

As for my studies, I’m deeply involved in data science and artificial intelligence,
constantly exploring new knowledge and skills to make an impact in this exciting field.
